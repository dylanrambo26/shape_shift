# shapeSHIFT
*A fast-paced obstacle platformer built in Unity.*

---

## 🎮 Overview

This project is a **2D obstacle-based platformer** inspired by the hit mobile games, *Geometry Dash* and *Color Switch*.  
The player automatically moves forward through a series of **obstacle-filled levels** — your goal is to **jump, flip, and dash** with perfect timing and precision!

Built with **Unity 2022.3.62f2**, this project demonstrates:
- Physics-based jumping and collision detection  
- Level looping and color-changing parallax backgrounds  
- Various obstacle stages 
- Modular, beginner-friendly code structure  

---

## 🧩 Features

- ✅ **Timing-based gameplay** – Switch to the correct shape corresponding to the action needed to clear the obstacle (i.e. square for a single jump, triangle for a double-jump, and trapezoid to dash through a wall) .

- ✅ **Expandable level design** – Can easily create new prefab obstacle patterns for more levels  .

- ✅ **One-button controls** – Space for shape shifting, left click for an action, right click to change color.

- ✅ **Color Matching** - Switch to the correct color to pass through color gates.
- ✅ **Clean and modular C# scripts**
